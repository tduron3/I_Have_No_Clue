My project is to determine if there are any correlations between political parties and COVID-19 in each state.  I will use each states's Electoral College and which political party each voted during the recent 2020 Presidential Election as a foundation.  With this base, I will examine any relationships surrounding vaccinations administered, vaccinations shipped/allocated, and the amount of positive cases; and related questions as the data admits.  This data will be utilized from multiple sites pertaining to the presidential election, vaccination and COVID-19, and COVID-19 health data.  Potential sites include the CDC, govtrack.us/covid-19#, in addition to repositories containing additional information needed to complete the project
